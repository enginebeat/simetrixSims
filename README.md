My Simetrix Simulations

Repository for several simulations, some connected some not.
 At this point i'm using mostely simetrix version 3.1d which is the version I have a full license for,
 but I am also using the new version in Demo mode.
 Noticed that as usual the new version can work with the files from the old version bu not vice-versa.
